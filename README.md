# Physical-Activity-Detection-with-Smart-Watch
The project aims to develop an android app that records the changes of different sensor data when wearer is moving by accessing the internal sensors of wearable devices. After it is stored in the mobile phone, the movement state of the wearer will be obtained by using the machine learning model developed by the back-end. So as to achieve high-level data integration from low-level data collection to machine learning.
